/**
 * Given information about the pending orders and DEs (Delivery Executives).
 * 
 * -Order (id, location, time when the order was placed) - DE (id, location,time
 * since last delivery)
 * 
 * The following three parameters must be considered while matching - Distance
 * between order and DE - How long the order is in queue - How long the DE has
 * been waiting
 * 
 * Design and code the above system. Consider the scalability challenges. - How
 * will the distribution among the servers happen? - What if there are premiere
 * customers who are given higher priority? - What if we want to give different
 * priority to each of the three parameters above for different regions? - What
 * if we need have different algorithms for different regions?
